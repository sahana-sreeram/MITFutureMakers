# MITFutureMakers

7 July 2021 - What did I learn?
  Today, we attended a seminar by Dr. David Kong about Leadership and Storytelling. I was so inspired by the stories by the two guest speakers that Dr. Kong shared  - they were extremely powerful and allowed every single member of the audience to relate and empathize. After this, we went into small groups to try and create our own unique stories. Ultimately, I was able to learn more about all of the inspiring members in the FutureMakers program, and I learned that everyone has their own special "story of self." Stories break down barriers and allow for more inclusive environments.
